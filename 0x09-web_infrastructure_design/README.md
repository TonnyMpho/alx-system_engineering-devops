## Web infrastructure design

#### A Server?
A server is a powerful computer designed to provide services, resources, or information to other computers or devices over a network, such as the internet. It stores data, runs applications, and handles requests from clients (users' devices).

#### Domain Name:
The domain name is like the address of a server on the internet. It's the user-friendly name that people use to access websites and services. It's easier to remember "www.foobar.com" than an IP address like "192.168.1.1".

#### Web Server:
The web server's role is to deliver web content to users' devices. It receives requests for web pages, processes them, and sends back HTML, images, and other assets that make up the website. Web servers handle the front-end presentation.

#### Application Server:
The application server handles the processing of more complex tasks related to applications. It manages application-specific logic, user authentication, dynamic content generation, and interactions with databases. Application servers handle the backend logic.

#### Database:
The database stores structured data, like user information, product details, and more. Both web and application servers access the database to retrieve or update information required for the website or application to work correctly.

#### Server Communication with User's Computer:
The server uses protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (secure HTTP) to communicate with the user's computer. The server responds to requests made by the user's browser using these protocols, delivering web content or application data.
